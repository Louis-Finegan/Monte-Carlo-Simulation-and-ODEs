# Monte-Carlo-Simulation-and-ODEs-

A brief discussion of applying Monte-Carlo Integration to Solving Ordinary Differential Equations Numerically. Contains:

1. Derivation of both Monte-Carlo and Euler Integrations.
2. Algorithm.
3. Calculated Errors and comparision between both schemes and the analytical solution.
